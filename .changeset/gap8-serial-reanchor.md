Serial worktree re-anchor (GAP-8): commitAndMergeWorkspace now returns the project-root post-merge HEAD ({ mergedHeadSha }), surfaced on RunPacketResult.mergedHeadSha so a serial loop driver anchors the next unit on the just-merged commit. prepareWorkspace now asserts the requested base commit resolves before cutting a worktree. Closes the PR #198 stale-base risk class for serial multi-unit runs.
